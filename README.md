#### React-Redux-Demo-Server
This api was created to support a react-redux demo.  It was bootstrapped with a starter kit (see license).

The entire project is a work in progress.  It may not be fully functional yet.

Eventually the postgres connection may be removed from this api in favor of a graphql implementation.
